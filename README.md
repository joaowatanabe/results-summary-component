### What I learned
 It is my second time trying to solve this challanges and i'm proud of myself, it's important to celebrate small achievements.

 learned some new things in CSS:
 ```css
@keyframes anima {
  0%{
    transform: scale(1);
  }
  100%{
    transform: scale(1.03);
  }
}

.btn:hover{
  background-image: linear-gradient(hsla(256, 72%, 46%, 1), hsl(241, 81%, 54%));
  animation-name: anima;
  animation-duration: 0.7s;
  animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
  animation-iteration-count: infinite;
  animation-direction: alternate;
}

```
 
### Continued development
The challenges have helped me a lot, to keep practicing and challenging myself to try new things and see things from another perspective.
I want to continue with my studies in CSS and already start some things in JS, and I intend to use some frameworks.
